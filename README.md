# 🔐 Microsoft Entra ID – Identity & Access Management Lab

📌 Overview

This project is a hands-on Identity & Access Management (IAM) lab built using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory).
It simulates real-world IT Help Desk and Cloud Identity scenarios, including authentication failures, MFA issues, and administrative recovery.

The lab follows an incident-based approach:

1. Build a working cloud identity environment

2. Intentionally break authentication and access

3. Diagnose issues using logs and admin tools

4. Restore access like a real IT technician

This mirrors how Tier 1–2 Help Desk and Cloud Support Engineers handle Microsoft 365 identity incidents.
